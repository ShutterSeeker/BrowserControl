# BrowserControl

A streamlined tool for Jasco warehouse operations that automates Chrome browser setup and login.

## What It Does

**Single Sign-On**: Enter your credentials once instead of twice - the app automatically logs into both DC (Distribution Center) and Scale systems.

**Smart Workstation Setup**: Select your workstation (Packing, DECANT.WS.1-5, PalletizingStation1-3) and the app automatically:
- Launches Chrome with optimized settings
- Navigates to the correct Scale pages for your station
- Arranges windows side-by-side for easy workflow
- Applies your preferred zoom level and dark mode settings

**Productivity Tools**:
- **SlotStax**: Mark all totes as arrived with one click
- **Decant**: Quick license plate search
- **Packing**: Auto-copy container IDs when closing containers
- **Bookmarks**: Fast access to frequently used Scale pages (Inventory, Transaction History, Reports)

## Quick Start

1. Launch `BrowserControl.exe`
2. Enter your Jasco username and password
3. Select your workstation from the dropdown
4. Click "Launch Chrome"

That's it! The app handles the rest.
